// duplicate the environ variable so i can change it freely without screwin something else
// environ works as KEY=VALUE
// look up for the value you want, if you find it, delete, if not, all good
// the delete works as in a swap, you overwrite the one you want to "delete", 
// and shift everything else on top of it
